        <details>
           <summary> My Childhood</summary>
              <p>I only have vague memories of a united family. I was five when my family life came crashing down; only it didn’t fall on me, it fell on my mother. The only memories I have of the divorce are not of a courtroom, but of my loving father being kicked out of the house he created. It was not until I was around seven that I learned my mother left my dad just because she was bored. The first time I spent with my dad after the divorce was ironically as soon as he was kicked out. This is just a made up story…</p>
